    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <p>Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
        But the very next day you gave it away<br>
        This year, to save me from tears<br>
        I'll give it to someone special
    </p>
    <p>Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
        But the very next day you gave it away<br>
        This year, to save me from tears<br>
        I'll give it to someone special
    </p>
    <p>
        Once bitten and twice shy<br>
        I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye<br>
        Tell me baby, do you recognize me?<br>
        Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
    </p>
    <p>
        Happy Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
        With a note saying "I love you", I meant it<br>
        Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
        But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
    </p>
    <p>
        Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
        But the very next day you gave it away<br>
        This year, to save me from tears<br>
        I'll give it to someone special
    </p>

        Ooooooooh
        Snow is falling, all around me 
        Children playing, having fun 
        It's the season, love and understanding 
        Merry Christmas everyone 
        
        Time for parties and celebrations 
        People dancing, all night long 
        Time for presents, and exchanging kisses 
        Time for singing Christmas songs 
        
        We're gonna have a party tonight 
        I'm gonna find that girl 
        Underneath the mistletoe, we'll kiss by candlelight 
        
        Room is swaying, records playing 
        All the old songs, we love to hear 
        All I wish that everyday was christmas 
        What a nice way to spend the year 
        
        We're gonna have a party tonight 
        I'm gonna find that girl 
        Underneath the mistletoe, we'll kiss by candlelight 
        
        Snow is falling, all around me 
        Children playing, having fun 
        It's the season, love and understanding 
        Merry Christmas everyone 
        Merry Christmas everyone 
        Oooh Merry Christmas everyone 
        
        Ooooooooh Snow is falling (snow is falling), all around me (all around me) 
        Children playing, having fun (having fun) 
        It's the season, love and understanding 
        Merry Christmas everyone 
        
        Snow is falling (snow is falling), all around me (all around me) 
        Children playing, having fun (having fun) 
        It's the season, love and understanding 
        Merry Christmas everyone 
        
        Snow is falling, {snow is falling} all around me {all around me} 
        Children playing, {children playing} having fun {having fun} 
        It's the season, love and understanding 
        Merry Christmas everyone 
        Merry Christmas everyone 
        Oooh Merry Christmas everyone 
        Oooh
